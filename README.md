Debian based OS's

Current OS is now Debian Based "AVLinux" which in turn is Based on "MXLInux" which is in turn is Based on "Debian Bookworm".
This install is using ZFSBOOTMGR and REfind Boot Manager in 512M EFI Partition and zfs zroot partition for rest of Disk.
AVLinux as I like to play back audio through my HiFi system. MXLinux as it uses zfs 2.3.0 from it's own repo.
At the moment my zpool is a 2 way mirror but might change to 3 disk raidz if I need more space.
